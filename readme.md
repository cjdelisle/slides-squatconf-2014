# Slides from Squatconf presentation 2014

The difference between Freedom and Empowerment is the difference between the people inside of the bank and the homeless people out front. Cryptography is not freedom, it locks us out of data which passes through our own computers. Bitcoin is not freedom, it makes us provide goods and services to people we don't know and it makes our financial transactions public. These technologies take away our individuality and our freedom but they also give us a collective voice.

Screw Freedom, I want Empowerment
